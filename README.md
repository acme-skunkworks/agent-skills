# agent-skills

Shared agent skills for Claude Code and Cursor, distributed as [skills.sh](https://skills.sh)-compatible bundles. Each skill lives under `skills/<name>/` with a `SKILL.md` manifest at its root.

## Installing a skill

From any consumer repo:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/rheged-studio/agent-skills --skill <name> --agent claude-code --agent cursor --copy
```

`--copy` writes real files (not symlinks) so the skill is portable across machines. Don't use `-g` / `--global` — installs should live in the consumer repo.

## Rolling the skills onto a repo

To deploy the shared set across a target repo — wipe its bespoke skill/command shims, install the canonical set, reconcile config, and verify — follow the [fleet deployment runbook](docs/fleet-deployment.md). It also covers the install-set per repo type, pinning to a tag, and the re-install/upgrade path.

The `skills/<name>/` convention may be refined by ADR-0001 (tracked in [A-133](https://linear.app/rheged-studio/issue/A-133)) once skills.sh's expected layout is double-checked.

## Architecture decisions

ADRs land under `architecture/` as `NNNN-<slug>.md`. ADR-0001 — the foundational decision record for skill layout, distribution conventions, and semver discipline — is forthcoming.

## Contributing

See [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) for estate-wide agent guidance and [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) for this repo's conventions (skill layout, `/send-it`, release-please versioning under the dual merge policy).
