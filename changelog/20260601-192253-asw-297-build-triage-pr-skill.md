## Added

- `triage-pr` skill at `skills/triage-pr/` — a skills.sh bundle (`SKILL.md` + `package.json` named `@acme-skunkworks/skill-triage-pr`) conforming to ADR-0001's layout. Takes a PR from draft with failing CI to merge-ready in two phases: **Phase A** (while draft) fixes in-scope CI failures — never weakening CI config to greenwash — and loops until green; **Phase B** (after a human marks it ready) fetches unresolved AI review feedback, validates each finding against the codebase, actions the valid ones, and declines the rest with technical reasoning.
- A `gh`-backed review-thread fetcher (`scripts/review-threads.mjs`) that surfaces the sticky AI review summary separately from inline review threads — the main silent-miss risk — normalises `[bot]`-suffixed login matching, and ships a `--self-test` suite (18 cases). `parseArgs` fails fast on unknown flags, missing flag values, and malformed `--repo` identifiers.
- Configurable `reviewBots` and `maxCiRounds` knobs via `config.json`.
