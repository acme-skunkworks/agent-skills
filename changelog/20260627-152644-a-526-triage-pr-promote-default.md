title: Default the triage-pr skill to promoting a green draft PR to ready-for-review
release_note: 'The triage-pr skill now promotes a draft PR to ready-for-review by default once Phase A CI is cleanly green, flipping the promoteOnGreen config default from false to true. The existing safety gates are unchanged — promotion is still suppressed unless the green is proven, there are no unresolved human review threads, and there is no unresolved base drift. Pass --no-promote (or set promoteOnGreen: false) to opt out and leave the flip to a human.'

## Changed

- **`triage-pr` promotes a green draft PR to ready-for-review by default ([A-526](https://linear.app/acme-skunkworks/issue/A-526)).**
  The `promoteOnGreen` knob in the skill's `config.json` now defaults to `true`, so
  a cleanly-green Phase A automatically runs `gh pr ready <pr>` — the gate that turns
  AI review on — and continues into Phase B, rather than stopping at green and
  leaving the flip to a human. The promotion gate is unchanged: the flip is still
  suppressed unless the green is *proven* (the watched rollup, never "no failures
  yet"), there are **no unresolved human review threads**, and `mergeStateStatus`
  shows no unresolved base drift (`BEHIND` / `DIRTY`). Pass `--no-promote` (or set
  `promoteOnGreen: false`) to opt out; `--ci-only` and `--dry-run` never promote, as
  before. Bundled as `triage-pr@0.4.0`.
