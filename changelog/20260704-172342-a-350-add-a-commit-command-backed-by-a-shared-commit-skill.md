title: Add a /commit command backed by a shared commit-grouping skill
release_note: Adds a standalone /commit command that turns the working tree into logical, atomic Conventional Commits with an out-of-scope guard — no push, PR, changelog, or Linear writeback. The commit-grouping contract is now a shared skill that /send-it delegates its commit step to.

## Added

**commit:** a new standalone [`commit`](../skills/commit/SKILL.md) skill and a
`/commit` command. It turns the working tree into logical, atomic Conventional
Commits: it classifies uncommitted files as in-scope vs out-of-scope against the
branch's merge base (`git merge-base HEAD origin/<base>`), shows a staging plan,
and **never** `git add -A`s — stray files from another branch or worktree are
flagged and never staged silently. In-scope files are grouped one commit per
coherent unit (type + optional scope + British-English body; `!` /
`BREAKING CHANGE:` for breaking changes). It commits only — no push, PR,
changelog, or Linear writeback. Contract-only skill: the grouping is model-driven
and the `SKILL.md` prose is the source of truth ([A-350](https://linear.app/acme-skunkworks/issue/A-350)).

## Changed

**send-it:** Step 3 now delegates to the `commit` skill instead of carrying its own
commit-grouping prose — the standalone `/commit` command supplies the second
consumer that justifies centralising the contract. The bundle is bumped to `0.6.0`
and now names `commit` among its required delegated siblings ([A-350](https://linear.app/acme-skunkworks/issue/A-350)).

Per-component atomic-commit splitting stays **parked** ([A-374](https://linear.app/acme-skunkworks/issue/A-374)):
`/commit` groups by intent, not component or package boundaries.
