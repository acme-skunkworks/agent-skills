## Fixed

- **The [A-582](https://linear.app/acme-skunkworks/issue/A-582) gitignore tests reference an undefined `dir`
  ([A-602](https://linear.app/acme-skunkworks/issue/A-602)).** The two `!`-unignore cases
  added to `tests/skills/initialise-skills/gitignore.test.ts` called
  `reconcilePreflightIgnore(dir, …)`, but the `describe` block defines the temp root as
  `directory` — so both threw `ReferenceError: dir is not defined` and `pnpm test` failed.
  The three references now use `directory`, matching the sibling cases. Pure test fix — no
  production code, no bundle version bump. It merged on a stale-green Build & Lint check
  (that gate runs on PRs, not on pushes to `main`), so nothing re-ran the suite against the
  trunk.
