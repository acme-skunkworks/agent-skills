## Added

- OIDC Trusted Publishing to npm (`scripts/publish-via-raw-npm.sh`, with `--provenance`) plus a GitHub Packages leg (`scripts/publish-to-github-packages.sh`), wired into `release.yml` and ported from `@acme-skunkworks/eslint-config`.
- `publishConfig` (`access: public`, `provenance: true`) in `package.json`.

## Changed

- Rewrote the `CLAUDE.md` Release section to document the dual-registry, dormant-by-design flow and a mechanical flip-to-public checklist. The pipeline stays dormant whilst `private: true` — it runs green and publishes nothing.
