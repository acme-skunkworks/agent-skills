release_note: Post-merge changelog finalise now runs in-repo via reusable-changelog-enrich and @acme-skunkworks/changelog-core instead of the orchestrator's inline Finalise step.

## Changed

Migrate `agent-skills` onto the in-repo post-merge enricher (Phase 3 · [A-797](https://linear.app/rheged-studio/issue/A-797)),
following the eslint-config canary:

- Add `@acme-skunkworks/changelog-core` and point CI `validate:changelog` /
  completeness at it.
- Fold `reusable-changelog-enrich.yml` (`mode: finalise`, pinned at [A-821](https://linear.app/rheged-studio/issue/A-821) SHA)
  into `pkg-release.yml` with `secrets: inherit` for road-runner-bot write-back.
- Keep `skills/changelog/scripts/*` as the published skill source — CI no longer
  shells out to them for validate/completeness.
