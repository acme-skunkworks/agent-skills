release_note: initialise-skills no longer flags changelog.packageRoots as needs-manual-input when affectedPackages is false, and documents the single↔monorepo config flip.

## Fixed

- **`packageRoots` gated by `affectedPackages` ([A-813](https://linear.app/acme-skunkworks/issue/A-813)).**
  On a single-package host the roots detector still returns null, but with
  `affectedPackages: false` the merge reclassifies `packageRoots` from
  `needs-manual-input` to `unchanged` and leaves the example placeholder in
  place. Runtime already ignored those roots when the gate was off; the report
  no longer trains operators to fill monorepo knobs they do not need. Bundled as
  `initialise-skills@0.10.7`.

## Added

- **`references/monorepo-config.md`** — agent-facing guide for the single↔monorepo
  flip (`acceptDrift` / `--set` when a prior `false` is drift), linked from
  `SKILL.md`, `detectable-keys.md`, and `docs/fleet-deployment.md`.
