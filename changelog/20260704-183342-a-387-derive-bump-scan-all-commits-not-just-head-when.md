title: 'derive-bump: derive the release type from all commits, not just HEAD'
release_note: Fixes /send-it under-deriving the release type on a branch whose HEAD commit is a chore/docs commit but which carries an earlier feat/fix. The bump, PR-title type, and changelog category are now taken from the strongest Conventional-Commit type across all commits — so a mixed branch ending on a non-release commit no longer silently fails to cut a release.

## Fixed

**send-it:** `derive-bump.mjs` decided the `feat:`/`fix:` release-type signal from
only the **HEAD** commit (`commits[0]`, since `git log <base>..HEAD` is
newest-first), while breaking-change detection already scanned every commit. A
branch whose HEAD commit was a `chore:`/`docs:` commit but which carried an earlier
`feat:`/`fix:` was under-derived: `/send-it` composed a non-release PR title,
release-please cut nothing, and the fixes never published. Under release-please the
PR title **is** the release signal, so this silently mis-cut real releases — the
workaround was a manual `--title` override.

Both buggy paths — `deriveBump` (the release magnitude) and `deriveCategory` (the
[A-598](https://linear.app/acme-skunkworks/issue/A-598) `type` / `category` / `releaseTriggering` decision) — now derive from the
**strongest Conventional-Commit type across all commits** via a new
`deriveDominantType` helper (`feat` outranks `fix`/`perf`, which outrank the
non-release types). When no commit is a release type the derivation stays on the
lead commit, preserving the changelog category for non-release branches.
`deriveBody` deliberately stays on the HEAD commit — it is an explicitly-draft
one-line summary the ship flow may rewrite ([A-387](https://linear.app/acme-skunkworks/issue/A-387)).
