## Changed

- Reworked `release.yml` to publish-only: dropped `workflow_dispatch` and the version-PR inputs (the private road-runner-bot `release-orchestrator` now owns versioning), added a pending-changeset detection gate, a branch-restricted `npm-release` environment, an idempotent tag/release step, and a release-failure issue notifier.
- Gated all four `@claude` triggers on `author_association`.
- Rewrote the `CLAUDE.md` Release section for the publish-only flow, the required-check contract, and the out-of-band operator setup.

## Added

- The required `🔬 Build & Lint` check plus `yaml-lint` (digest-pinned yamllint + actionlint) and `infra` (shellcheck + bats) jobs in `validate.yml`, and a new `infrastructure/` tree (hash-locked tool installers, `.yamllint.yml`, and bats coverage of both publish scripts).
