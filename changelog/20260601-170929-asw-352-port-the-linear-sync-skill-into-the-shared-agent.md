## Added

- New `linear-sync` skill under `skills/linear-sync/`: transitions the Linear
  issues linked to the current branch through their workflow states (In Progress
  / In Review / Done), resolving live state IDs by team **name** (stable across
  team-key renames) and applying each transition idempotently. Pure Linear-MCP —
  no supporting scripts.
- The Linear team name and issue-ID prefixes are parameterised via `config.json`
  (with a neutral `config.example.json` template), mirroring the `cleanup-repo`
  bundle.
- A local `/linear-sync` command wrapper drives the standalone start-of-work
  transition (default target In Progress).
