## Changed

- **Shared `@acme-skunkworks/*` devDeps brought to published latest ([A-1341](https://linear.app/rheged-studio/issue/A-1341)).**
  `markdownlint-config` ^3.0.0, `eslint-config` ^1.1.3, `changelog-core` ^1.1.1,
  and `commitlint-config` ^1.0.1. The agent-skills package version itself is
  unchanged (already at 1.4.0).

- **markdownlint 3.0.0 fallout cleared.** Underscore italics (MD049), proper-name
  casing for Linear (MD044), fenced-code languages (MD040), and command-shim
  frontmatter titles (MD041) updated across docs, historical changelog entries,
  and skill prose. Touched skill bundles patch-bumped so their published
  metadata stays in lockstep with the content edits.
