## Added

- **`release-status`:** version preview reads **commits since the last tag** on
  the configured trunk (`git log <tag>..origin/<mainBranch> --no-merges`) instead
  of merged PR titles, so the advisory bump matches release-please 17.9.0 under
  multi-commit (non-squash) history
  ([A-824](https://linear.app/acme-skunkworks/issue/A-824)). Evaluating against
  `origin/<mainBranch>` (not local `HEAD`) keeps the preview aligned with the
  trunk even when the helper is run from a feature branch.

## Changed

- Strongest-type ranking is unchanged (`feat`→minor, `fix`/`perf`/`revert`→patch,
  `!`/`BREAKING CHANGE:`→major; docs/chore/…→none). **Policy:** a `feat:` later
  `revert:`ed in the same window still implies **minor** — no cancel/netting —
  matching release-please's `DefaultVersioningStrategy`. Merge-commit subjects are
  excluded so a merge body's PR title is not double-counted against branch commits.
- Report JSON field `mergedPrCount` → `commitCount`; human copy updated accordingly.
- Skill bundle bumped `0.1.5` → `0.2.0`.
