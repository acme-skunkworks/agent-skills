## Added

- **`triage-pr` (0.14.0):** Phase B human envelope (and the slow-bot micro-gate)
  prefer a structured Questions UI — Cursor `AskQuestion` or Claude Code
  `AskUserQuestion` — with batch **Yes / No / Other** (**default yes**), an
  Option A disposition-grouped detail block (soft-capped declines), and thread
  permalinks from the review-threads fetcher. Prose `[Y/n]` remains the
  fallback when neither tool is available. The same contract applies on
  `/send-it` chains and Step 12 re-envelopes
  ([A-1647](https://linear.app/rheged-studio/issue/A-1647)).
