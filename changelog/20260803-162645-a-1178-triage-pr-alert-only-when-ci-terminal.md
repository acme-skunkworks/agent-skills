title: Only alert the human once triage-pr CI is terminal
release_note: triage-pr no longer claims a run is complete while required checks are still queued, pending, or in progress — the human is only alerted at the final report once every required check is terminal.

## Fixed

- **Step 6 / Step 12 alert carve-out.** Clarified that documented Phase-A early stops (promotion disabled / gate failed / `--ci-only` / `--dry-run`) are valid completion alerts, not interim mid-watch pings — Step 12 remains the alert for a full run.

- **Completion contract ([A-1178](https://linear.app/acme-skunkworks/issue/A-1178)).**
  Agents must not claim the triage run is complete, green, or ready for attention
  while any required check is still queued, pending, or in progress. Step 6 stays
  quiet during the watch; Step 12 is the only completion alert and must cite the
  proving command's fresh terminal states. Bundle bumped to `0.8.3` (via `0.8.2`).
