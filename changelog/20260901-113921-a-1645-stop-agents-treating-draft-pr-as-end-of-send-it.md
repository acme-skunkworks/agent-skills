title: stop agents treating draft PR as end of /send-it
release_note: Skim-level send-it and triage-pr copy no longer reads as complete once a draft PR is open. Done criteria, a Step 11 completion gate, and clearer prerequisites make the triage chain part of a default /send-it run; stopping at an open draft without an explicit skip reason is a failed run.

## Fixed

- **`send-it` (0.8.2):** skim surfaces that still ended at "open a draft PR" /
  "In Review" — package.json description, CLAUDE.md invocation comments,
  "finisher" framing, and `` `triage` _(optional)_ `` / "`triage-pr` — optional"
  wording that read as the _step_ being optional. A default run now states
  **done criteria** up front and a **completion gate** at Step 11: reporting a
  draft PR URL as the final outcome without `ℹ️ triage chain skipped …` and a
  reason is a failed run ([A-1645](https://linear.app/rheged-studio/issue/A-1645)).

- **`triage-pr` (0.13.1):** replace "complements `/send-it` (which **opens** the
  draft PR)" with language that `/send-it` opens or updates the PR and then
  **invokes this skill as Step 11**. Standalone `/triage-pr` remains for
  mid-flight re-entry, not the normal end of send-it.
