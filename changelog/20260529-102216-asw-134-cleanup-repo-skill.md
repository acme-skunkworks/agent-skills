## Added

- `cleanup-repo` skill at `skills/cleanup-repo/` — the first skills.sh bundle in the repo, conforming to ADR-0001's layout (`SKILL.md` + `package.json` named `@acme-skunkworks/skill-cleanup-repo`).
- A branch/worktree pass (a faithful port of Octavo's `/cleanup-branches`: two-pass merge detection, an uncommitted-changes worktree guard, protected branches, and an opt-in, default-no Linear `Done` writeback) and a new filesystem-hygiene pass (`scripts/filesystem-hygiene.mjs`) that prunes top-most recursively-empty directories and orphaned `node_modules/`, with a `--dry-run` preview matching the real run.
- A `skills-ref validate` manifest-lint gate in `validate.yml`.
