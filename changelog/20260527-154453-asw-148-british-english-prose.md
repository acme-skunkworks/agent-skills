## Added

- A `## Writing style` section to `CLAUDE.md` requiring British English spelling and grammar across prose (comments, docs, commit messages, PR bodies, user-facing strings), explicitly carving out identifiers, dependency names, third-party API field names, and quoted upstream text — the rule applies to prose, not code.
