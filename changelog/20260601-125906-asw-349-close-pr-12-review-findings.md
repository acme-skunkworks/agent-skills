## Fixed

- Dropped the bats cache `restore-keys` prefix in `validate.yml`, matching the exact-key-or-cold policy already used for the yamllint and actionlint caches.
- Pre-exported `PATH` before the `command -v` guard in `ensure-yamllint.sh` (mirroring `ensure-bats.sh`), so a cache-restored binary is discoverable and a cache hit skips the redundant re-install.
- Corrected an inaccurate comment in `publish-via-raw-npm.bats` and renamed `view_output` → `view_stderr` to match the sibling suite.
- Single-sourced the actionlint version via a job-level `ACTIONLINT_VERSION` env, removing the dual-maintenance footgun.
