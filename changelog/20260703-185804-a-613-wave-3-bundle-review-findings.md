## Fixed

**preflight:** the two early-exit paths (empty diff / no lintable changes) now
thread the resolved `blockOnWarnings` into `buildSummary`, so
`.preflight-summary.json` reports the configured value rather than the default
`false` when preflight short-circuits ([A-613](https://linear.app/rheged-studio/issue/A-613)).

**changelog:** `backfill-commits` now synthesises a minimal `stats:` block for an
entry that omits `stats` entirely — the contract permits this — instead of
throwing `no stats block to extend`. `commit-count`'s missing-`parents` fallback
is documented and pinned by a test (a commit without parent data counts as
authored work, never a merge). The `add-links` / `backfill-commits` /
`finalise-changelog` CLI-entry guards now use the two-sided `realpathSync`
comparison used elsewhere, so a symlinked entrypoint (macOS `/var`→`/private/var`,
the pnpm store) no longer skips `main()` ([A-613](https://linear.app/rheged-studio/issue/A-613)).

**initialise-skills:** a deliberately un-ignored `.preflight-summary.json`
(`!.preflight-summary.json`) is now reported as a distinct `negated` status,
honouring `.gitignore`'s last-match-wins rule, instead of being mislabelled
"already ignored" ([A-613](https://linear.app/rheged-studio/issue/A-613)).

## Changed

**changelog / send-it:** the `pr` frontmatter field is now documented consistently
as owned by the release/enrich step — resolved post-merge from the entry's
`branch:`, never written by the ship flow. Reconciles the changelog skill, the
changelog contract's field-ownership table, and send-it's Step 7 ([A-676](https://linear.app/rheged-studio/issue/A-676)).

**triage-pr:** the Linear-resolution rule is kept inside the bundle rather than
pointing at a sibling skill's file, the `skills-ref` validation command is pinned
to `@0.1.5` to match CI, and the README synopsis is refreshed for the
`promoteOnGreen` default ([A-613](https://linear.app/rheged-studio/issue/A-613)).
