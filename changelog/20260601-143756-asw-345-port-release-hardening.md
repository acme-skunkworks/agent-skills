## Added

- A build-once-publish-exact 3-job `release.yml`: an unprivileged `build` job packs one tarball, and `release` (npm OIDC) + `publish-github-packages` (provenance attestation) each publish that exact artifact, so no build-time code runs alongside a publish credential.
- The `load-repo-config` composite action over an allowlist-validated `infrastructure/repo-config.yaml` (node-version-file, registry URLs, npm scope).
- The dated-changelog system (`changelog/<ts>-<slug>.md` entries + `finalise` / `enrich` / `stamp` / `add-links` / `validate` helpers, wired into `changeset:version` and `/send-it` Step 5b).
- Husky hooks (`pre-push` blocks direct `main` pushes, `commit-msg` strips the Claude trailer, `pre-commit` runs lint-staged).

## Changed

- Scoped the npm tarball to the skill bundles via `files: ["skills/"]`.

The machinery is fully wired and exercised in CI but stays dormant whilst `private: true` — it publishes nothing until the flip-to-public.
