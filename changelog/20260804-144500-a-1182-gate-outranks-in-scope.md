title: triage-pr lint-surface gate outranks the in-scope bucket
release_note: Step 3's In-scope bullet now states that the lint-surface gate takes precedence, so a lint failure whose only remedy is a config change or ignore directive cannot be classified in-scope and fixed before reaching the gate.

## Fixed

- **Bucket precedence in Step 3 ([A-1182](https://linear.app/rheged-studio/issue/A-1182)).**
  The **In-scope** bullet told the agent to fix any lint failure reproducible on
  the branch head, and it is listed *before* **Lint-surface gated**. A reader
  matching the buckets top-down could classify a lint-only-surface failure as
  in-scope and fix it before reaching the gate. The In-scope bullet now names the
  precedence explicitly: **Lint-surface gated** takes precedence, regardless of how
  clearly the failure belongs to the PR.

  Raised by Cursor Bugbot on [#152](https://github.com/acme-skunkworks/agent-skills/pull/152)
  and approved there, but landed after that PR merged — hence this follow-up.

## Changed

- triage-pr bundle `0.10.0` → `0.10.1`.
