// Exercises the BUNDLE helper directly (the distributed `.mjs`). isCliEntry backs
// the CLI guard for every changelog script, so its branches are covered here rather
// than only indirectly through each script's `--self-test`.
//
// Real files (and a real symlink) are used so every branch is genuinely hit: the
// symlink case proves resolution on both sides, and the mismatch case compares two
// distinct *resolvable* paths so it reaches the `===`-returns-false branch rather
// than the `catch`. `argv` inside the helper is `process.argv` (same array
// reference), so tests mutate `process.argv[1]` and restore it.
